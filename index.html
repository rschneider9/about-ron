<p>Howdy! My name is Ron Schneider, I'm 30 years old and from New Mexico.</p>
<p>I was a bartender for 12ish years, and finally had enough of dealing with  <strong>PEOPLE!</strong> ... although not so much the cocktails, I miss those. </p>
<p>My passions are building computers, shirley temples, playing video games like Mario Kart or Just Dance on the Wii , and pickle-ball! </p>
<p> You may be wondering about the cushions in my photo. Well, between you and me I take them from hotel swimming pool chairs because I hope to one day have my own pickle-ball shaped swimming pool. </p>
